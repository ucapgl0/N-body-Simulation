Purpose
-------

This project serves as a starting point for the PHAS0100 Assignment 2 Gravitational N-body Simulation coursework. It has a reasonable folder structure for [CMake](https://cmake.org/) based projects,
that use [CTest](https://cmake.org/) to run unit tests via [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). 

Further information on the specific project is left as an exercise for the student.


Credits
-------

This project is maintained by [Dr. Jim Dobson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/dr-jim-dobson). It is based on [CMakeCatch2](https://github.com/UCL/CMakeCatch2.git) that was originally developed as a teaching aid for UCL's ["Research Computing with C++"](http://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/research-computing-with-cpp/)
course developed by [Dr. James Hetherington](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/people/james)
and [Dr. Matt Clarkson](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MJCLA42).


Build Instructions
------------------

To build this project.

First, turn on the IDE(like VS code) by Dev Container and open the project as the folder.

Second, open new terminal and input the comand below on terminal to build the document.

```Bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
<!-- if you want to toggle on/off all std::cout for the benchmarking, put this link to cmake build type:
```Bash
cmake ..-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG=Debug
``` -->
After building document, users could run the project following the run instruction below.

### **Command-line app**

There is a command line app in this project which is solarSystemSimulator.

User could input comands below from the build directory to check the help information:

```Bash
./bin/solarSystemSimulator -h
```
or
```Bash
./bin/solarSystemSimulator --help
```

And user could input the step-size (the time of each step) and the time(total time of simulation) to simulate the plants system. This is the instruction:

```Bash
./bin/solarSystemSimulator -s <step-size, unit:year> -t <time, unit:year>
```

This is an example for  timestep of 0.000274 years (this is~0.1 days) and then run the program for 1 year of simulated time:

```Bash
./bin/solarSystemSimulator -s 0.000274 -t 1
```

The app will output the positions of plants in solar-system and the Kinetic energy, potential energy, total energy of plant system at the beginning and end of simulation, and the time of code running.

### **Unit Tests**
Users can input the command below to run the file "unit_test.cpp" to test.
```Bash
ctest -V
```

### **Test the solarSystemSimulator**

I use a timestep of 0.000274 years (~0.1 days) and 1 year of simulated time as an example to test solarSystemSimulator app.

### **The energy of solar system**

In this part, I run for 100 yearâ€™s worth of simulated time and for 10 different timestep sizes(from 1e-7 to 5e-3 year) to summary the results of solar-system energy and benchmark the runtime.

The energy at the beginning of simulation: 
The Kinetic energy:0.187358

The Total energy:-0.169514
The total energy at the end of simulation: 
The Kinetic energy:0.102706
The Potential energy:-0.240089
The Total energy:-0.137383
CPU time used: 44.48 ms
Wall clock time passed: 44.52 ms
```

By the result, we could see the original total energy is $-0.169514$ before the simulation. After 100 years time simulation, the total energy by shortest timestep size $1*10^{-7}$ is $-0.169503$ which is the closest to original value. On the other hand, the total energy by longest timestep size $5*10^{-3}$ is $-0.137383$ which has largest difference as original value. In addition, we can observe that the energy is far from the original energy with the decrease of timestep size. Therefore, we could deduce that the accuracy increases as the timestep size decrease.

However, although the result is the most accurate of choosing timestep size $1*10^{-7}$, the runtime is longest which is $2117319.95$ ms(~35minutes 17seconds), and it takes so much time. The result of choosing step size $5*10^{-7}$ is the second most accurate with $-0.169463$ which three significant digits are accaury, and the runtime is $507377.13$ ms (~~8minutes 27seconds) which is reasonable.

Hence, I choose the timestep size $5*10^{-7}$  as the good value of timestep to balance between simulation run time and accuracy. 

### **Parallelise 2000-planet-system simulation by OpenMP**

I choose timestep size 0.00137 year(~0.5days) and total time 1 year to 2000-planet-system.

**Before using OpenMP to Parallelise simulation:**

```bash
./bin/solarSystemSimulator -s 0.00137 -t 1

CPU time used: 156996.29 ms
Wall clock time passed: 157303.18 ms
```

It takes 2minutes 37seconds runtime approximately. 

**After using OpenMP to Parallelise simulation:**

```bash
./bin/solarSystemSimulator -s 0.00137 -t 1

```
It takes 41seconds runtime approximately, so the performance improved is significant after parallelice simulation.

CPU time used: 144226.06 ms
Wall clock time passed: 38547.19 ms
```
It takes 38seconds runtime approximately.

**Set OMP_NUM_THREADS = 16 to Parallelise simulation:**
